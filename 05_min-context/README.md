The Context API in React is a feature that allows you to share data across multiple components without passing props manually at every level. It is part of React's built-in state management tools, introduced to solve the problem of prop drilling â€” where props need to be passed through several intermediate components even when only the child components need the data.

Key Features:
Provides and Consumes Data:
The Context API uses two main components:

React.createContext(): Creates a Context object.
Provider: Wraps components and provides data to them.
Consumer: Allows components to access the provided data.
Use Case:
It's commonly used for:

Managing themes (light/dark mode)
User authentication and permissions
Language localization
Sharing global configuration settings
