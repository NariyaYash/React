React Fiber Example

Introduction
    This project demonstrates the React Fiber Architecture with an interactive dropdown component. React Fiber, introduced in React 16, optimizes rendering by breaking updates into interruptible and incremental tasks. It ensures a responsive UI, prioritizing user interactions over background operations.


Key Features of React Fiber:

Interruptible Rendering: Tasks can be paused and resumed as needed.
Prioritization: User interactions are handled before lower-priority tasks.
Concurrent Updates: Background tasks do not block UI updates.
Incremental Rendering: React updates in small chunks, keeping the app responsive.
Improved Performance: Complex updates are managed efficiently without freezing the UI.

This app contains:
    A dropdown component that fetches data in the background after the component mounts.
    While the data is being fetched, the dropdown remains interactive.
    React Fiber ensures user interactions are prioritized, even if data fetching takes time.
    How It Works

How It Works:

Initial Render:
    The dropdown displays a placeholder ("Select an option") while waiting for fetched data.
    The useEffect hook starts fetching data asynchronously.

User Interaction Before Data Loads:
    Users can interact with the dropdown, but only the placeholder option is available.
    React prioritizes this interaction, ensuring smooth UI behavior.

Data Fetching Completion:
    Once data is fetched, the dropdown is updated with new options.
    React Fiber ensures this update is applied incrementally without blocking the main thread.

Incremental Rendering:
    React handles rendering updates in chunks, maintaining responsiveness.
